Description:

The Industrial Personnel Classifier System reads video frames 
from a remote video source, identifies human subjects within
each frame and then classifies the human within one of the
following categories:

worker              = green safety vest
supervisor          = orange safety vest
unauthorized person = no safety vest

Human subject recognition and localization is accomplished using
an SSD_MobileNet V2 model running in a TensorFlow 1.9 session.
Vest color classification is accomplished by color segmentation
of either green or orange pixel masses over a statistical range
above a specified pixel count threshold within the regions of interest
containing human subjects.  Color segmentation is performed using
OpenCV 3.0 .

Setting Up Video Source
-----------------------

The application requires a video stream accessible via a URL.
Demonstration of the system can be accomplished using a VLC
server on a local network.  The VLC server can be created on 
a computer running Ubuntu with a USB webcam or a laptop with 
a built-in webcam.  The VLC server software can be installed by:

sudo apt-get install vlc

After installation is complete, the video source may be streamed over
the local network by entering the command:

vlc v4l2:///dev/video0 input_stream --sout "#transcode{vcodec=mjpg, \
width=320, height=240}:std{access=http, mux=mpjpeg, dst=0.0.0.0:8080}"

The device '/dev/video0' may require a different device number such 
as '/dev/video1' etc.

It is important to note the IP address of the VLC server on the local
network since this address will have to be used in the Personnel Classifier
application.

Running the Personnel Classifier Application
--------------------------------------------

In order to run the personnel classifier application a simple edit must
be made to the source code.  This requirement will be eliminated in the
next revision of the application where the IP address can be entered 
on the command line or via a configuration file.

The IP address of the VLC server should be entered on line 208 of the 
main source file named 'personnel_classifier.py'.

1.) Initiate the video stream on the VLC server.

2.) Verify the iWave q7 board has network connectivity on the local network 
    by pinging the VLC server host machine.

2.) Start the personnel classifier application on the iWave q7 RZ/G1M 
    development board by entering the commands:

    cd /home/root/personnel_classifier
    python personnel_classifier_main.py --num-workers 3

    The number of workers determines the number of parallel TensorFlow
    sessions that are created as separate processes for object
    recognition.  It appears that 3 workers is optimum.

Please note that each time the personnel classifier application
is run, a file named 'outvid.avi' is created.  This file is a video 
recording of the processed frames and has the same content as the real-time
processed video displayed on the board during the session.  If you do not
want to record the video, line 235 in the main source file named
'personnel_classifier_main.py' may be commented out.

Dependencies
------------

1.) Glocol Networks e-AI Ready Modified iwg21m-release-bsp with TensorFlow 1.9 Python support
2.) Green and Orange Safety Vest (or any day-glo green and orange fabric will work)
3.) VLC Server + webcam on a local network

In order to run the personnel classifier application a special 
AI-Ready BSP for the iWave q7 RZ/G1M Development Board is required.
The download instructions for the BSP will be provided by Glocol Networks
by email request to:  raiford@glocol.net
